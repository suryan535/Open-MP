Openmp Group Assignment - Many Body Simulation
Group : H

The steps to run the many body problem are the following:
1. Download the Source Code file 'many_body_sim_program.cpp' and to the same path, add the Text file 'Trajectory.txt'
2. Run the source code in a parallel environment after adjusting the number of threads 
3. After successful compilation and running, the output will be the time taken displayed on console as well a 'Coordinates.txt' file which contains the 3D coordinates of the bodies for given time will be written in the same path as the source code.
4. Now, open the 'Many_Body_Problem_Graphic_Visualiser.m' file in MATLAB and in the code, supply the 'Coordinates.txt' file path to 'filepath' variable.
5. Save and Run the MATLAB Code.
6. The visualisation of all the bodies inside the box over time can be seen as Animated Plot.
7. After complete simulation, a video 'ManyBodyGraphical.avi' containing the animation will be saved at the same path as the MATLAB code.

For the Given 'Trajectory.txt' in the problem statement, the output video file obtained can be accessed here "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k1X1H4EXTN7tk7fdBDWdjN4e3QWQG2Xj/view?usp=sharing"
